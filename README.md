# OpenParlBrief

An autonomous AI agent that monitors Canadian parliamentary committees, automatically transcribing meetings and publishing factual summaries through Twitter and RSS feeds.

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by Murad Hemmadi's reporting in [The Logic](https://thelogic.co/news/parliament-ai-cohere/) on the federal government's ParlBrief AI tool, developed by the Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) team. OpenParlBrief aims to create an open-source, publicly accessible version of similar capabilities.

## What it does

OpenParlBrief automatically:
- Monitors OurCommons and ParlVu for new committee meetings
- Transcribes audio using AI (OpenAI Whisper)
- Generates factual, non-partisan summaries
- Posts Twitter threads with key highlights
- Publishes RSS feeds organized by committee
- Maintains a searchable archive of all proceedings
