# OpenParlBrief

A project scope for an open-source AI agent that could monitor Canadian parliamentary committees and share automated summaries.

## Status

ðŸ“‹ **Concept Stage** - This is currently just a project scope and technical plan, not a working application.

## What's Here

This repository contains the initial planning and scoping work for what could become an autonomous parliamentary monitoring system. See [plan.md](plan.md) for the complete project scope, technical architecture, and implementation ideas.

## Background

Inspired by [Murad Hemmadi's reporting in The Logic](https://thelogic.co/news/parliament-ai-cohere/) about the federal government's internal ParlBrief AI tool developed by ISED.

## Contributing

This is a starting point - contributions, ideas, and discussions about building this (or similar tools) are welcome.
